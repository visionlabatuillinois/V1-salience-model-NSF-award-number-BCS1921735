# To run this code:
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
# 1. Install Python 3 (This code was developed using Python 3.7)
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
Make sure the following modules/libraries are installed and available:
os, sys, math, datetime, numpy, Pillow, mpi4py

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
# 2. Update the input and output path information for the images you want to run
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
These are found in the main() method at the bottom of runfilters_contrast.py
The default paths are
    inpath = './data/input_images/'
    outpath = './data/output_images'

Put the files you want to analyze in the 'inpath' directory

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
# 3. Open a terminal window and execute the following command in the directory where the code is located
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
mpirun -np 2 python3 -u -m mpi4py.futures ./runfilters_contrast.py 2
